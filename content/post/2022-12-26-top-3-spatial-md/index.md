If you are on this page you probably know what R is and you are looking to learn about spatial data packages in R that will help you do analysis and build some beautiful maps — or you are tired of Python resources and are looking to spice things up. I am not going to bore you with details on why I think you should learn R but jump right into it.

I have been using R for close to 9 years now and when transitioning into geospatial data science I started building a list of open-source resources for myself. In this article I will share with you my top 3 open source technical resources and hope they help you as they have me.

###  Introduction to spatial data programming by Michael Dorman

Published and hosted via R [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) and frequently updated, this technical book starts with a section on introduction to R and puts it in perspective to other spatial books in R.

It then focusses on the basics of handling and working with spatial data in R, vector and raster alike, along with techniques for common geometric operations for both.

Although it has a section of advanced spatial analysis its focus is very much on giving beginners an easy introduction to performing spatial data operations in R.

### Geocomputation with R by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow

This has been my popular go-to book for learning geospatial programming in R. It starts by offering some basics of spatial data operations in R and scales to cover some applications, advanced topics and other extensions of R-spatial such as specific packages for map making, integration to other GIS software and some geo-statistics. It covers a broad area and gives a holistic introduction to r-spatial ecosystem for every level of programmer out there.

The Foundations sections at the start is similar in focus to several other open source resources where it introduces packages like *dplyr, sf* but the key point here is that foundations section builds on to the later sections with more application oriented examples, mapping etc. with the same packages introduced in foundations. This allows for a beginner to follow along from the beginning of the book to the end, building skill and knowledge that smoothly flows into the more applied and advanced examples.

If you’re a beginner or an intermediate learner this book is a good place to start to get more exposure to some advanced topics such as modelling with spatial data without getting too overwhelmed by the details.

### Spatial Data Science with applications in R  by Edzer Pebesma and Roger Bivand

Written by the authors who have build and maintain most of the spatial packages in R such as *sf, sp, stars, spdep, gstat* and widely known in the geoinformatics and R-spatial community this book is a technical treatise for an advanced reader. If your looking to understand the fundamentals behind these packages or looking to make open source contributions to these packages this book would be a great place to start.

This book is divided into 3 sections — **spatial data, R for spatial data science and models for spatial data.** The spatial data section deals with geometries in spatial data such as points, lines, polygons etc. and starts with the basics of coordinate systems . It really lays the foundation for geo-informatics in general. R for spatial data science deals with application of the packages such as *sf* (for example) to spatial data, the very creation of spatial data, how it works and how to work with it for mapping. If you’re looking to just build some maps I would suggest you head directly to this section. Models for spatial data deals with some geo-statistical techniques using r-spatial packages such as spatial autocorrelations, regression, spatial interpolation, point-pattern analysis that are commonly used during spatial analysis.

This book is for an advanced reader who isn’t happy with just straight-away using some r-spatial packages but is looking to get their head around the foundations behind these packages. Its therefore for this reason sometimes a useful reference for a better understanding of some concepts.

### Final Thoughts

There are several easily accessible resources to learn spatial data science in R and depending on what your looking to learn you may find something to meet your need. I am generally a fan of open-source resources especially those written by experts in an accessible manner and these three should be a great place to start.
