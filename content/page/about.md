My name is Kiranmayi Vadlamudi. This is my personal website that's under development.

I am geospatial data specialist with an interest in making maps and visualisations.

I am professional trained in complexity science and systems biology.



### my history

<!---
To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

2009: I graduated school with a focus on sciences (math, physics, chemistry and biology)

2009-2014: I did a dual or integrated sciences degree (BSc and MSc) in Systems Biology from University of Hyderabad. I was also an [Inspire scholar](https://online-inspire.gov.in/) during this time. My university was a brilliant place for a young mind to have the first exposure to academic research. I met lot of great scientists and researchers and learnt a lot. My degree had an equal focus on wet lab experiments and programming. I was a bit more inclined towards programming, I learnt Fortran and C and taught myself MATLAB. I also attended several international and nation conferences in systems biology and computational neuroscience during this time. I did my final year research thesis in computational neuroscience and non-linear dynamics, modelling and studying the synchronisation of claustral neurons.

2014-2015: After graduation I was looking to do a PhD and got admitted in IISc, Bangalore and Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSC), Chennai. I decided to join IMSC, Chennai for a PhD in computational biology.  After a year of coursework I felt I wanted to do more applied work and move away from basic sciences so I decided to leave the PhD in hopes of opportunities better suited for me. Fortunately for me, I also met my husband during this time. Some of the work I did during my time here can be found **[here](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/computational%20biology).**

2015-2017: This was a highly experimental time in my life. I was wanting to look into how I could use my skills for more socially oriented work. I interviewed and got into [TISS](https://www.tiss.edu/) for an MA Sociology, but decided against joining the program. I also became a certified yoga teacher during this time.

After much dilly-dallying I finally thought to continue studying more on [non-linear dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory) to build on my computational modelling skills of non-linear system with the hope of one day building models that could benefit humanity and have an impact. I applied to study MS in complex systems and got through in [Vermont University](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/), [Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/courses/msc/) and [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/pc/master-of-complex-systems0.html). I chose to study at University of Sydney due to personal reasons.

2017- 2019 : I had a very good experience at University of Sydney. The program was new and I was among the first cohort of students to graduate with a Master of Complex Systems. These two years were a great learning experience for me in academics and in life. I started working part-time as an international student and transitioned into industry roles. My first role was as research associate for my centre, centre for complex systems. I worked on studying how salmonellosis spread in New South Wales using anonymised patient data. This work led to a **[publication**.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42582-3) You can explore the code for the work [here](https://github.com/KiranmayiV/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Spread%20of%20Salmonellosis%20in%20NSW). I also got exposed to the application of complexity science to urban systems and learnt how much I enjoyed working with spatial data. For my final year research work I modelled displacement in Sydney driven by gentrification and explore the socio-economic factors driving it.

2019 - present: Since graduation I have worked in various roles involving data and joined AHO in 2021 as their Senior Research Analyst.
